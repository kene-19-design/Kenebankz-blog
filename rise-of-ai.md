Artificial Intelligence is no longer science fiction — it’s shaping our daily routines, from smart assistants to AI-generated content like this blog. As we embrace this technology, we must balance its benefits with ethical considerations.

- **Work:** Automation is speeding up workflows, especially in coding, marketing, and customer support.

- **Privacy:** More data is being used to personalize services — sometimes too much.

As AI grows, staying informed is our best tool.
