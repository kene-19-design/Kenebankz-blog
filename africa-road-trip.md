Africa’s roads taught me patience, awe, and how to fix a flat tire in 40°C heat. Driving through savannas, deserts, and bustling cities in my red Jeep gave me a new perspective on freedom.

Highlights included:

- 🚙 Getting lost in Namibia and finding hidden waterfalls
- 🦁 Hearing lions at night in the Serengeti
- 🌍 Making friends across language and cultural barriers

This wasn’t just a trip — it was a transformation.
